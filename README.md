# Algorithm Visualizer

I created a algorithm visualizer web app using `Javascript, VueJS, HTML & CSS`. Specifically, it visualizes how `DFS, BFS and Dijkstra algorithms` work when trying to find the shortest path between a start and end cell. Please checkout the project [here](https://sainitind.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer/)

I created this because I wanted to improve my Javascript and VueJS skills. It took me a while to complete this project but the whole journey was worthwhile. Not only did I improve my javascript and VueJS skills, but I also improved a lot of my HTML & CSS knowledge/skills. 

Finally, I have to give props to Clément Mihailescu. This project is inspired by his pathfinding visualizer project.
